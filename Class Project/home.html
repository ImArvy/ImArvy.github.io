                <h2>About Our Collection:</h2>
                <h3>A collection of S7NS STATION Genesis NFTs that give you ticket access to The Station Of
                    Sins. With Stakeholder System, the first dynamic minting smart contract: ERC721-S7, and an
                    innovative airdropping smart contract, S7NS STATION will provide passengers with utilities
                    from various sources. The seven deadly sins - pride, envy, anger, sloth, greed, gluttony, and lust
                    are the inspirations for the artwork. The boundaries between the digital and biblical worlds are
                    becoming hazier, and new regulations are emerging.
                </h3>
